# diffusion-lagr

This is the codebase for [Synthetic Lagrangian Turbulence by Generative Diffusion Models](TODO)

This repository is based on [openai/guided-diffusion](https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion), with modifications specifically tailored to adapt the Lagrangian turbulence data in the Smart-TURB portal http://smart-turb.roma2.infn.it, under the TURB-Lagr repository.

# Training models

Training diffusion models is described in the [parent repository](https://github.com/openai/improved-diffusion).
